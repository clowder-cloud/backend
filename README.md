## Setting up for local development

### Prerequisites

This README assumes you have Docker installed. If you do not, please read [this](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) manual, based on your operating system. It will cover setting up and testing your very own Docker instance (lucky you!)

### Requirements

- Node: `7.0.1`
- Docker: `27.3.1`

### Steps

#### Cloning and initial setup

1. Clone the repository with
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/clowder-cloud/backend.git
   ```
2. Enter the cloned repository locally, typically with
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
3. Install all dependencies with
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

#### Setting up the database

1. Ensure your Docker instance is started by running
   ```bash
   docker info
   ```
2. Compose the Docker container with
   ```bash
   npm run setup-db
   ```
3. Copy the containers IP, which is retrieved by running
   ```bash
   npm run get-docker-ip
   ```

#### Creating the environment

> [!WARNING]  
> If you are using Docker Desktop (primarily for Windows and MacOS), you should change `HOST` to `localhost` and `PORT` to `54320`

1. Create a new `.env` file at the root of the project
2. Refer to the `example.env` file, replacing values where required
   1. The `DATABASE_URL` will be constructed of values from `docker-compose.local.yaml` and the output of previous steps.
      1. If you have not changed any values, you can copy & paste this into your `.env` - `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://root:root@HOST:5432/clowder"` and skip to step 5
      2. `POSTGRES_USER` will be our `USERNAME`
      3. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` will be our `PASSWORD`
      4. `POSTGRES_DB` will be our `DATABASE`
      5. The IP copied from [Setting up the database](###-Setting-up-the-database) will be our `HOST`

#### Migration and Seeding

> [!WARNING]  
> If at this point you get an error with connecting to the database, try changing the port in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to `54320`

1. Run all of the migrations by executing
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
2. Seed the database with
   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```
3. You can check the database is migrated and seeded by running
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```

#### Running the server

1. You can start the development server with
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Running the application

1. Execute `npm run dev`. This will run the `nodemon` instance, allowing for a smooth experience without having to restart the server.
